3. Platform
The program is compiled on windows 10 under Visual Studio 2013. External libs include log4c++, boost and tinyxml2. However, all the dlls are already included, so it should work. I also needs the c++ runtime libs.

The rest is in the Readme.txt file.

7. Disclaimer

This is the first version of the release and I am fully aware that much more work should be done to make it easier to use and run more efficiently. So I cannot guarantee that the code is completely bug-free.
